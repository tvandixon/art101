      <h1>The Squiggle</h1>
      <h5>Date Created: 1974</h5>
      <p>Originally called "Untitled" by creator Kenny Farrell, the Squiggle is cemented as one of UCSC's prized landmarks. Here you can see people doing all sorts of things - from studying to playing with Tech Decks, the Squiggle doesn't discriminate what you do!</p>

      <h1>Koi Ponds</h1>
      <h5></h5>
      <p>At Porter College, there is a lovely koi pond. The pond is a well known spot surrounded by classrooms and the Sesnon Art Gallery. Many people find the place calming and may sit on the benches while studying, reading, or even meditating. You need to check out the hidden koi pond on the other side of campus upon the pogonip trail. It is very different since forest lands surround it.</p>

      <h1>The Wishing Tree</h1>
      <h5>Near Tree 9</h5>
      <p>The Wishing Tree is located in Upper Campus near Tree 9. There are various trails that lead to the Wishing Tree, but the closest way from campus is to go from College 9 and hike up through the Merrill Meadow. Then there is a road that will take you directly there! You may find the Redwood Cathedral Ring and Tree 9 as well! When you get there, you may write your wish on a piece of paper, leave it on one of the branches, and wait for it to come true!</p>

      <h1>The Caves</h1>
      <h5>(Porter/Empire Cave Entrance)</h5>
      <p>As the water percolates through the fractured marble and limestone, it picks up CO2 and becomes a mild carbolic acid, further chemically eroding the limestone/marble, creating karst geography resulting in caves and sinkholes (such as the giant sinkhole in front of the engineering building). They’re easy to find; simply head down the hill behind the Porter/Kresge Dining Hall into the meadows. Continue into the forest, and there will be a path. Follow this path down, and it will lead you directly to the Porter Caves! HellHole is another notable mention worth exploring. Adventure Awaits!</p>

      <h1>Garden of Eden</h1>
      <h5>(1-1.5 Hour Hike)</h5>
      <p>The Garden of Eden is a well-known hidden hotspot where students relax under the sun or swim in the bright blue creeks. It is a very clean environment with beautiful scenery making it the perfect place to relax on a sunny day. Head up the hill beside Merrill, once you reach the top of it you will turn right. As you continue walking along that path, you will eventually pass the apartments on your right. You will then hit a trailhead. Follow this trailhead until you reach the bottom. There will be an option to go to the right but stay to the left. This will lead you to a road that you can cross. Head straight down onto railroad tracks and follow them heading left, and you will eventually find this spot on your right. It’s a decent walk alongside the railroad so be prepared. Note that it is an uphill hike on the way back!</p>

      <h5></h5>
      <p>The Porter Meadows is a grassy area filled with vegetation and many trees that is west of the Porter dining hall. Many sorts of activities may take place here. Many people come to hike and explore the area since it has many winding trails and animals that appear here and there. Others like to walk their dogs or go for a run. Some students go for the various raves and smoke-outs. These areas include the cave gulch and the forest area near the Empire Grade road. Be careful when hiking there at night. Bring a flashlight and some good hiking shoes! </p>

      <h1>The Rock Garden</h1>
      <h5>Near the Historic Lime Kilns</h5>
      <p>Walking on the Pogonip trail and keeping forward, you’ll reach the historic Lime Kilns on your left which is something to definitely check out. On top of the kilns is The Rock Garden which is a quiet and peaceful place where people come and write down their dreams, secrets, etc and place them under rocks. Heading into the location, you’ll see a pathway of rocks leading to the center of the area that is marked by rocks in the shape of a peace sign. Around the area, you’ll see pillars of rocks.</p>

      <h2>Location: Elf Land (where College 9 & 10 are now)</h2>
      <h4>When I was an undergrad I frequently used to walk in the forest. One of my favorite places was Elf Land that was a section of forest with many faerie rings (places where a big redwood tree was cut down, clones of the mother tree grew around it in a ring, and then the original tree rotted away creating a little room). It was magical and students would go there and meditate and trip or just enjoy the forest and the ways people had given it love. It was completely cut and bulldozed to make College 9 and 10.</h4>

I loved going into the caves on and off campus. One time my friends gave me a toke at the bottom of Hellhole and I was so stoned I thought I wouldn't be able to get back up to the surface.I was still stoned the next day. WTF?</h5>

      <h2>Location: Whole Earth Restaurant and Chadwick Garden</h2>
      <h6>Alan Chadwick co-created a vegetarian and organic restaurant at UCSC on the idea that healthy food could be delicious. Chadwick created the Chadwick garden to supply the restaurant. He pioneered organic gardening and is at least partly responsible for the organic food movement. Whole Earth was started in 1070 and closed in 2002, a victim of the university's neoliberal economic policies. (https://www.iascollectivemuseum.com/linda/) The Whole Earth restaurant was an amazing place to eat good inexpensive food on campus. I miss it. The Chadwick Garden is still one of my favorite places.</h6>

The trees were parted in a tunnel like shape, with only that one spot able to be seen through in the whole brush - but right there he was, a few yards away, watching me with his ears perked to the side and hoof mid step, paused until I left.</h4>
