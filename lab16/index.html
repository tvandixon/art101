      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>As a group once again, there were a few challenges we had to face for lab 16. The most prevalent obstacle to getting this lab completed efficiently was our travels back home for Thanksgiving break. After enjoying our much needed time for
        relaxation and family, we came back together to complete this lab.</p>

      <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
      <p>The only issue that we faced during the construction of this lab was pinpointing the technique we should use in order to display the comic onto the page correctly. At first we were using .html in order to display the content but that didn't
        work due to the content overwriting itself. Using the lecture from last week as reference, we decided that appending the content proved to be the easiest way to get the result we wanted.</p>
