    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
    <p>For lab 11, there were a number of challenges we had to face as a group. There were a lot of obstacles that were out of our control that prevented us from completing the lab as soon as we wanted. Tristan unfortunately suffered from a consistent migraine throughout the weekend, while Alex and Jacquelyn were overwhelmed with other assignments that they had to complete. On top of these unforseen circumstances, we had a hard time following this week's lab instructions as well. Unlike previous labs, this assignment provided little-to-no visual context to the instructions - leaving us blind for how Wes wanted the code to be done. There are many ways of accomplishing the task through JavaScript and jQuery, leading to us wondering if we were doing it correctly. In the end, we feel like we accomplished what was asked of us and that we overcome these challenges despite their difficulty.</p><br>

    <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
    <p>In regards to our coding process, there was a lot of troubleshooting. Whether it be adding the buttons to specific portions of the code on the page or programming their functions, it took a lot of trial and error. Through the help of W3schools we were able to solve those problems and finish the lab correctly.</p><br>
