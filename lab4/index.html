		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>Our main challenge was understanding the assignment's directions for Task 4. Some of the instructions were worded in a way that made us question whether or not we were doing things correctly. </p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>We were told what pseudocode is but we don't see how it's important to the lab. It feels like were missing something. If the pseudocode was implemented into a preexisting index.html file, it may have been easier to see its purpose. The border radius for one of our text boxes won't round out like the rest of the box. It's like there's a glitch in the code.</p>

			//How to Bake Cookies:

				//Roll dough into small balls and place on baking sheet.
				//Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes!
				//BAM! Cookies. MIC DROP.
