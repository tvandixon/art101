    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
    <p>For lab 13, we had a lot of scheduling conflicts as we were all traveling for various personal reasons. Beyond traveling conflicts, our final TA session was short-lived and we didn't get to discuss Loops or Lab 13 at all. Since we are all in different cities, we couldn't work together in-person, so we continued to complete the lab via Discord.</p><br>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
    <p>As for coding loops, some of us struggled during the lecture to have a successful operating number loop. There was a lot of out-of-class research to be done to get this lab done successfully. We also struggled with printing the JS functions since the example screenshots didn't feature the basic code.</p><br>
