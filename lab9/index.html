	<div id="outcomes-info1">
		<p>As a group once again, we did not face any challenges during this lab. There were a few instances of conflicting schedules due to prearranged Halloween activities, but other than that we found time to come together and finish the lab.</p>

		<h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
	</div>

	<div id="outcomes-info2">
		<p>We faced very few problems during this lab. In the early steps of its creation, we had a hard time getting the JavaScript output to display, but discovered that it was due to an AWOL quotation mark in the code.</p>
