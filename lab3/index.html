	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>

	<p>This lab focused on the idea of file organization and the linking of certain files within HTML. Through this process we will be able to create interconnected sites with multiple functions and other interesting forms of interactivity.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<p>In this lab, me and my partner faced challenges with some of the naming structures that pertained to linking certain files. For example, I created a folder to hold my main site and had a very hard time linking to sibling sites. Eventually I just needed to scrap the folder and place the index and css files into the root Art 101 folder.</p>
