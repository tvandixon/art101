	<div id="outcomes-info1">
		<p>Again, as a team we struggled finding time to come together to work on this assignment due to other classes and the other assignments that are due in this class. However, Alex and Jacquelyn worked through some troubleshooting in discussion while Tristan was continuing to deal with his emergencies back home. Eventually we all came together to complete the lab despite the circumstances we were facing.</p>

		<h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
	</div>

	<div id="outcomes-info2">
		<p>The team struggled with some preliminary errors and syntax issues in our code. Most of this is because of some of the missleading vocabulary that was used on the assignment. Understanding what was a variable name and a function name within the lab instructions were confusing. Eventually we were able to get past this and finish.</p>
