      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>The biggest challenge that we had to face for this lab is balancing the work load between the working team prototype assignment and this lab. In most cases, there were very few labs that needed debugging, but each of us eventually found one
        that could be worked on.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
      <p>When it comes to the code, we did not face any problems during this lab. Since time has passed and we built upon our early expertise of programming we were more comfortable revisiting some of the older labs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="debugging">
      <h2>DEBUGGING</h2>
      <p>While I haven't experienced many issues with javascript and HTML when it comes to my labs, I have often found issues when it comes to CSS. Since we barely touched on its attributes and functions, for a long time I struggled to make a
        coherent site across all platforms. So, I went back to a lab that I found challenging when it comes to CSS (lab 9), and fixed it with the knowledge I have of the code now. Instead of using margins and padding to lay out the page in its
        entirety, I made it very simple like my other labs by choosing a color scheme, removing the gifs and destructive divs, and adding the taskbar at the bottom.</p>
